WARNING: These are some rough notes.. Work in progress

Prerequisites
-------------


* http://www.mongodb.org/[mongodb] is the database management system
  (of the noSQL genre) used to store the EHR data

* http://www.python.org/getit/[Python]. You need to install Python
  version 2.6 or 2.7 which is the most current (in the 2.x branch --
  the code has not been tested with 3.x) at the time of this
  writing. The python code requires some additional libraries:

 .. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools[EasyInstall] will make more
    easy the installation of the additional libraries.

 .. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/[pymongo] 

 .. http://lxml.de/installation.html[lxml] NOTE: In Linux lxml
    requires libxml2 and libxslt to be properly installed so you 'd
    better install these with the package management tool of your
    Linux distribution (e.g. apt-get in Debian/Ubuntu) to look for
    packages like libxml2-dev or libxslt-devel if the build with the
    easy_install fails

 .. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gevent[gevent] which in Linux (and
    other *nix systems) also requires the installation of libevent


Configuration
-------------

* Change the line "MONGO_HOST=..." in ub.py and xds.py if mongodb is
  installed in a different machine instead of localhost.

* Change the configuration in the file config.ini in the "hl7" folder

* ...

Run
---

* If mongodb is not run as a service, start it...

* Start XDS by issuing (in a command line window):

 python xds.py

* Start Update Broker by issuing (in a command line window):

 python ub.py
